Q.Some people believe it is often necessary, even desirable, for political leaders to withhold information from the public. Others believe that the public has a right to be fully informed.

difference between because and since.
military,
secrets,
corruption


Leaders are meant to solve the problems of public. People are expected to know the information from political leaders in power. I believe that most of the information can be shared to public.  


In few cases, the ruling political leaders need to hold back information from public. Consider national military secrets as an example. The military secrets cannot be informed to public due to national security threat as it may be risky to the armed forces.
Secret operations like government planning to kill the terrorist. This information cannot be revealed to public since terrorists might know the information from social media and may escape. In the above cases, leaders should not reveal the information to public.


In most cases, public has a right to be fully informed by the leaders. This is primarily because every citizen of the country has to know the annual budget because most of the money comes through taxes paid by the citizens. In this case, leaders need to reveal information about the budget by displaying the information in the government websites and the finance minister should address public and inform them about how the budget is planned to be distributed among various sectors. 


In addition, public needs to be informed regarding the assets of the political leaders. In few cases political leaders might become corrupt and increase their illegal assets, hence if public knows the information of assets of political leaders in power on a regular basis then political leaders might reduce the corruption. 

In conclusion, in most cases, political leaders need to provide information to public but in few cases, they should withhold the information from the public.
