Q.We learn our most valuable lessons in life from struggling with our limitations rather than from enjoying our successes.

Success and failures are both sides of a coin. Many have argued that success cannot be enjoyed without the failures.Research shows that failure is a part of the road to success and we should all accept it.During the struggle to succeed, a person can learn a lot about their limitations and in the process of overcoming the limitations his confidence increases.Therefore, I believe that more can be learned from the struggle than from enjoying success.

 
During the struggle, most of the person will overcome their limitations and understand their true potential.Best example is Thomas Alva Edison who was fired from the first two jobs for being non-productive and failed for 1000 times in the process of inventing the light bulb.When asked by a reported he told that he didn't fail thousand times but the light bulb was invented with 1000 steps which means that each step is a learning.This shows that failures are the stepping stones for success. 

Additionally , it is during the times of struggle the most heroes emerge.Heroes such as Martin Luther king are praised till today for his bravery and spotless moral character.Prior to slavery and segregation of their times while he was a preacher he understood the life lessons but during the struggle for inequality his character was clear to him to teach the entire nation about equality and peace.     

Numerous examples illustrate that struggle teaches more valuable lessons than success.During the American revolution , American colonies struggled for their freedom from British suppression.In the absence of struggle the great lessons cannot be learned.Such revolutions teaches us more valuable lessons like independence and freedom which can not be learned with success.   

Therefore i agree with the claim that most valuable lessons in life are learned during the failures than in success since struggles expose the true potential of the person.
