Q. Governments should offer a free university education to any student who has been admitted to a university but who cannot afford the tuition.

strongly agree.

Education is the most important factor behind the success and overall developement of a person.Government has to provide free education to economically students.
This helps the students to continue their education and becomes successful in career. 
 
I agree with clam that government should offer a free education to eligible student who can't afford the tuition fee.
Many countries have high illiteracy rate making them incompetent with the other countries.
To over come this kind of situations more people need to be educated.
A highly educated individual is probably very likely to get a good job.
For example, in India tuition fee is high in both private and government universities with high illiteracy rate and still a developing country.
Students who got admitted to university but can pay the fee are not allowed to attend the classes or exams.
In this kind of cases the Government should provide free education to the eligible student which helps them to succeed in career and contribute to the nations growth.

Considering the increasing fee in private institutions government also should regulate the fee structures of private organizations.
This also helps students to get more time to concentrate on studies instead of doing part time jobs.
Also, stick Measures need to be taken to make sure that whole process should be transparent and the money to be funded for valuable education is not misused .


Therefore, I agree goverment should offer a free university education to any student who has been admitted to a university but canot afford the tuition fee.
But, need to provide free education from schooling.Education is basic of every human on this planet.To deny this right is evil.The Government of all countries must ensure to spread education.
