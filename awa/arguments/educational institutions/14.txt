Government should work for the welfare of the people. People are expected to question the Government when it takes decisions which harm the society and economy. Therefore i believe that People have to question the Government.


In few cases, while the government works for the long term benefits of the people where the people are not aware of the benefits and start questioning the government. Consider GST(Goods Service Tax) Bill which was introduced in India as an example. Although so many people protest and questioned the government concerning the tax percentage to be paid, after few months people understood the importance of it. In this case authorities need to address the concerns of  people and explain the importance of bill.

In most cases the society will grow when many of its people question authority.During the times of questioning the authority, most heroes emerge such as Mahatma Gandhi from India also called as father of the nation and fought with piece against the British during the time of freedom Struggle. Many people followed Gandhi during his protests and questioned the British authority for their freedom and thus achieved it.In this way society will become better when people start questioning the authority.


Numerous examples illustrate the above statement.This is primarily because if the government officials misuse the power and do the fraudulent policies then people has to raise their voice against them other wise scams will increase and country growth decreases. People should be smart and responsible enough to identify the scams by reading the news papers and government websites.

Therefore I mostly agree with the statement that many of the people question the authority then the well-being of society is enhanced. When people are brave enough to question, then authorities become responsible enough to resolve their problems.
