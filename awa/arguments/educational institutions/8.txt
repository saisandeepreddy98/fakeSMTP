Government is meant to solve the problems of people. Government must not spend huge amounts on the scientific researches whose results are unpredictable .If the consequences of research cause any damage to the humanity then government should not fund these scientific researches.  

In few fields of study, Government can fund scientific researches where the results are unclear.Consider an example, ISRO(Indian space research organization) which is funded by Indian Government where scientists are planning to build a huge telescope which they can utilize to explore about different galaxies.If this kind of cases fail in this research ,it will not cause any harm to society or environment.
 

In most fields, governments must not fund any scientific research where the result are unclear.This is primarily because if the research in few fields fail, then it may effect globally. Consider space research of discovering the aliens that is funded by the government.If the scientist build a transmitter which transmits the signals from one galaxy to another galaxy, the consequences are unclear.Suppose the aliens receive the signal and may enter our planet to colonize.

Numerous example illustrate that depending on the consequences government should fund or restrict researches.Consider medical field as an example.If the researcher works on finding the vaccine with out taking care of consequences,might invent a new virus which cases more damage to society. In such cases government
must consider the budget spent on the research and it's consequences.For some developing countries it will be a burden on the governments to spend a lot of amount on experiments whose result is unknown.


Therefore i mostly agree with the statement that government should not fund any scientific research where the results are unclear.Government should allow only authorized researchers to perform the experiments in order to reduce failed consequences.
