 Education is the most important factor behind the success and overall development of an individual.University are the driving force for providing the quality education and honing the skills of student.university students are expected to choose different courses other than their main stream.Even though it is difficult for students to learn but it is important to have minimum knowledge on general fields.
 
 
 In few Cases,if university forces students to select a subject which is out of their interest,inactive students will lower the overall performance of course.
 This effects the student's performance in their major subjects as well.These extra courses may also distract the students from their major fields and reduce the time they have to explore their primary subject of interest.
 
 
 In most cases,its beneficial for students to pick the basic courses like environment sciences which is important due to the current situation where the climatic changes happening rapidly.Students need to be aware of environmental conditions because they are the future citizens.For example, if they have awareness on global warming now, they can take necessary measures to control it is too late.Choosing vocational courses like agriculture or arts will help the student in their livelihood.   
 
Moreover,numerous examples illustrate student need pick courses outside their major field.In each semester students should have an option for elective subjects apart from the major ones.Consider an example of computer science student who took economics as a secondary subject in curriculum.This helps him to choose MBA in future for his career growth.  

Therefore,I mostly agree with the statement that it is beneficial for students to choose classes that are not their major.If it is ensured that all the subjects are balanced in a semester it helps in the overall development of a student.
