A true leader drive the peoples who work under them to the path of success.

In most cases, leaders are created by the demands that are placed on them.

Consider Ms Dhoni as an example who is a true leader in world cricket till date. Ms Dhoni has struggled in his intial stages of carier but the Indian team management believed in him and gave a responsibility to lead the Indian cricket team in his intial stages of his carier. He took the demands and leaded india to victory in all the formates of game and players who played under his leadership has a drastic improvement in their carier. He is true inspiration for lot of crickets who are emerging in their carier. The responsibility placed in him made him a true leader.

Additionally, it is during the times of demand the most leaders emerge.leaders such as Martin Luther king are praised till today for his bravery and spotless moral character.Prior to slavery and segregation of their times while he was a preacher he understood the life lessons but during the struggle for inequality when he became a true leader and teached the entire nation about equality and peace.

Numerous examples illustrate that leader will be created from the situations that are placed on them.However most argue these personalities are born to be leader but when the situations raise world will be able to see their ability.

I agree with the statement that leaders are created by the demands that are placed on them.In want conculed with a quote “worlds will see leaders, as long as there are problems to be solved”.
