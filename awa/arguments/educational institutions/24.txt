Q.A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.

mostly agree 

Education is the most important factor for the success and overall development of an individual. It is expected that students are required to study the same curriculum until they enter the college. I mostly believe in the statement mentioned above.

In some cases, students need to have a different curriculum until the end of schooling. Consider the Indian education system as an example. India is a vast country and diversified with about 28 states and 20 languages where each state follows their own curriculum. Students in different states are supposed to learn their corresponding mother tongue languages. Because of language barriers, they don't have common syllabus and in each state, government will conduct separate exams for their students. In this case, students will have different curriculum throughout schooling.

In most cases, students need to have the same curriculum until they finish schooling. This is primarily because of students can be assessed accurately with the common exam when they enter the college also test conductors are responsible for accessing the students accurately. Countries which they speak a common language throughout the country then this kind of common curriculum helps the students.

Numerous examples illustrate that students need to have a common syllabus until they enter college. Take the United States of America education system as an example. In the USA student will have the same curriculum until they finish high school. This is one the reasons why USA is the most developed country because today students are tomorrow citizens so providing common syllabus will treat each student without biasing. 

In Conclusion, i agree with the statement that nations should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.
