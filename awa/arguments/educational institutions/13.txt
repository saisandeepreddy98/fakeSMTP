Passion has been driving ordinary people to achieve extraordinary things.Most of the great inventions are driven with passion on the common idea where they started thinking differently.I believe that passionate and interest on the common things drive to get the best ideas.   

In the contemporary world ,with new start up culture, entrepreneurs are picking the common ideas and trying to build solutions for it. MarkZukerBurg was passionate in computer science and has created a simple application to connect with his peers in the university and named it as Facebook. Currently this application is used by billions of people to interact with their friends and family all over the world. This is a basic idea but because of the  passion towards the computer science he was able to build such kind of robust application. 

Numerous examples illustrate that best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things.Founder of KFC outlet was a complete failure and got rejected for many jobs.He was passionate about chicken and he knew a recipe of preparing the delicious chicken.At the age 70 he started the outlet and sold the delicious chicken which was liked by numerous people. Later on, thousands of outlets emerged across the globe.

On the other hand, in some fields of research commonplace thing will not work. Scientific researches conducted in laboratories is not a commonplace thing. To find the cure of any deadly disease, it takes tremendous amount of time and a lot of scientists to work collaboratively. For finding the cure of Ebola the collective effort  of scientists made it possible.  


Therefore I mostly agree with the claim that best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things and not from sophisticated things.
