rQ. Claim: In any field — business, politics, education, government — those in power should step down after five years.

Reason: The surest path to success for any enterprise is revitalization through new leadership.

As per the claim, it is necessary to make the people in power to step down after five years because 
the surest path to success for any enterprise is revitalization through new leadership.
I disagree with the claim to a great extent but not completely.

 
In most cases,people in power should not step down after five years.
If Bill Gates served for Microsoft as CEO for five years and stepped down, will the company be in this position today?
The Answer is definitely no.Bill Gates has a long term vision because of which Microsoft built stable operating system and many softwares.
Take an example of the Apple company.We all know when Steve jobs was sacked from apple and what happened after his reappointment.
In the above examples long term strong leader ship has benefited the companies and their employees.

Considering the rapid changes occurring globally its important for a leader to be updated in their respective fields.
If a new member is appointed as leader for every five years, its challenging for him to adapt to new situations and learn the tricks of trade as he can't match the knowledge of an experienced person.
This will be a huge loss to the organization. Thus, this practice will result in a rise and fall pattern of the company.


Just like we say every Coin has two sides, long term leader ship will be disadvantageous too.Take an example of Hitler.
Hitler was continued in a high position for long time in Germany's leadership which led to the country's transformation from democracy to dictator ship and even caused world war too.

This is my view of the claim.Leaders stepping down from power in any field like business, politics,education and government, is not always the surest path to success to grow through new leadership.
