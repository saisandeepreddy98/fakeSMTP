Q. Colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country.

explore different place which gives them confidence that they can live after their university or college


Education is the most important factor for the success and development of an individual.Universities are the driving force for the quality education and honing the skills of student.University students are expected to study atleast one semester in foreign country.Even though it is difficult for some students to habituate to the climatic conditions and cost of living ,it is important for them to get global exposure.

In few cases,if the univeristy forces students to study one semester in foreign country which is out of their interest,due to various reasons.For example, if a student is suffering from  migraine, they can't live in cooler places since migraine will effect the person's health badly.In this kind of case,the student might not show interest in studying in the country whose temperature is lower then the current one.If a student is not rich but the cost of living in foreign country is high then the student will not show interest in studying over their. 

In most cases,Universities requires their student to study one semester in foreign country.This is primarily because student will get exposure to different ways of study and culture which gives them confidence and clarity on their future goals.If a student who is interested in pursuing masters after completion of their bachelor's degree is sent to a foreign country to study for one semester,it gives him a clear idea on the foreign university's curriculum , the way of teaching and exams structure.This helps the student to understand whether he can pursue his masters in foreign country or in the same country.

Numerous examples illustrate that, students are required to study one semester in foreign country.Education does not mean only the academic subjects  of the  university, it should provide the student a confidence and guidance to move on with his life in future.Education of one semester in foreign country will also help the student in explore different cultures and traditions and make them a global citizen.

Therefore, I mostly agree with the statement that colleges and universities require their students to study one semester in foreign country and provide all the basic facilities like accommodation to students.
