Q.Although innovations such as video, computers, and the Internet seem to offer schools improved methods for instructing students, these technologies all too often distract from real learning.

mostly agree

--they student can improve a lot 
--the students are mainly distracted to games and social media on Internet
--parents also need to take care of students to not deviate from  learning

Two decades ago there was limited Internet and technology but now it has evolved to every part of the world. If schools teach their students with the help of videos , computers , and the Internet students get attracted  and often misuse it. Therefore I believe that most of the times students get distracted from real learning.


In few cases innovations like videos,computers, and the Internet will improve methods for instructing students at school.Schools have improved a lot in teaching ways in this decade by providing students with online classes,recordings of the classes in student portals. In few schools the students are provided with tablets where they can learn different courses online apart from the curriculum and they can search for the information very easily. Schools are also providing online forums where all the lecturers and students will be connected and the students can post any questions in their mind or read the Blogs written by lectures or other students.It is up to to the student to use these resources effectively.

In most cases technologies are distracting students from the real learning.When schools use the technologies to instruct students, as they get attracted to the Social media platforms where most of the students spend their time watching videos and chatting with friends apart from learning and also waste time on playing online games. Since the teenagers may not distinguish between what is right and what is wrong, this access to technology and Internet could be of negative effect on them. 

Recent researches stated that students whose Schools offer technology based instruction using videos, computers and the Internet are the students whose screen time is increasing day by day and this might cause more negative impact on the students like loss of creative thinking and reduced physical fitness due to lack of sports or physical exercises. Schools and parents should motivate the students about the learnings that they can do on Internet and provide an awareness regarding the negative use of technology.

Therefore i mostly agree with the claim that innovations such as video, computers, and the Internet are improving the teaching at schools but these are also distracting them from real learning. Technologies are invented for the good and can be of great help if utilized properly.
