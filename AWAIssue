Q,To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.

A,In some cases,most important characteristic of a society need to be studied in major cities of the country.
Take London for instance.Lodon is the capital and biggest city in England.
When I was working in London,i see an incident where there was an accident happened on a road.The person was hit by the bike.
Within 5 min police and ambulence has arrived and the doctors stated they need to do operation on the road it self other wise person will not dead.
Immediately all the required setup was bought in the helicafter ,they did the operation on road and saved the person.This kind of incidents show how much importance they give for saving people.


However,in most cases, most important characteristics of a society need to be studied in small cities of the country. 
This is primarily because so many countries depend on agreeculture.The People who do agreeculture mostly live in the small towns and villages.
Take India as an example.In India 70% of the people are depend on the agreeculture who lives in small cities and villages.
In India all the major cities get food supply for the small towns and viallages.
The Major revenue will be exporting to foreign countries is rice and barley which is cultivated in the small cities and villages.

Moreover, numerious examples illustate that important characteristics of a society need to be studied in small cities of the country.
Take scotland as an example.Scotland is famous for scorch preparation.
The scorch prepartion will be done mostly in small towns and villages where there is pelenty of water.
In this kind of counties we need to study the charateristic of socity in small cities and villages only.

Therefore the characteristic of society need to study both major cites ,small cities and village to get a complete understanding of the society.
